# JS-Func
A repository for Javascript functions I find are interesting, useful or both.

A lot of credit to the folks over at https://1loc.dev/

Some of the functions were inspired by 1loc,
a lot of functions copied from 1loc and refactored to be clearer,
and the rest were copied as-is.

# Testing

To run all tests at once, simply use
>yarn test

To run a specific test, use
>node tests/&lt;method_name&gt;.js
